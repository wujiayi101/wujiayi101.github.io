## Developer in Devcontainer

[`Devcontainer`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) spins up a development environment in a container so you don't have to install the dependencies on your host machine:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running
2. Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and `Dev Containers` extension
3. Open this project in vscode
4. Launch `Command Palette` from the UI or run `âŒ˜ + Shift + P` if you are on Mac
5. Select either `Reopen in Container` or `Rebuild Container` to start the Devcontainer
6. Once Devcontainer starts up, open vscode terminal, and use the commands in the following section to develop and debug.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
