# Problem

Have you ever seen a project has a long list of installation steps, you relunctantly follow the readme to install the list of software required, and.. it doesn't work. You reached out to your colleague who worked on this project previous, he said _works on my machine_. Well, with Visual Studio Code (vscode) Devcontainers, this will no longer happen.

# What is Devcontainer?

vscode Devcontainers allow you to develop your project inside a container as a full-featured development environment, while also leveraging the features of the vscode IDE. Each project has its own devcontainer, every team member working on the same project can spin up the exact same development environment with one-click

# Wait, do I have to use vscode?

I know what you are thinking. Yes, devcontainers are only available in vscode, so you have to install vscode, but trust me, if you are not already using vscode, the benefit of devcontainer will become a strong incentivie for you and your teams to start using vscode. 

## How do I get started?

### Pre-requisites

1. Install the Docker Desktop client.
1. Install vscode.
1. Install `code` command
    
    1. Open vscode

    1. Search and and choose `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`
