## Something to Brag About

I completed my [first marathon](https://worldsmarathons.com/marathon/xiamen-international-marathon) on January 7th, 2024. The idea of running a marathon had been on the back of my mind for a few years, but I never took it seriously or felt physically ready. Last summer, I started gaining weight and decided to start running regularly. Instead of running without a goal, I thought it would be a good idea to sign up for a marathon.

## Building Up the Mileage

### 16-Week Training Program
I found a [16-week training program](https://www.facebook.com/notes/781931189269115/) that I believe had a moderate intensity, and I managed to stick to the schedule, except for one week when I was dealing with a nasty stomach bug.

### Low Heart Rate Training
During my runs, I focused on keeping my heart rate low (learn more about [low heart rate training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_VNQ6UIbS8)). This allowed me to run more frequently, recover faster, and avoid injuries. Compared to six months ago, I am now able to run at a much faster pace while maintaining the same low heart rate, which is quite amazing. I used a Garmin watch to monitor my heart rate and set an alarm to alert me if I exceeded my low heart rate threshold, so I could slow down.


### The Tale of Two Shoes
I purchased two pairs of shoes: the _Adidas Boston 12_ and the _Adidas Adios Pro 3_. I alternated between these two pairs on different days. Each shoes provided a different running experience, allowing me to target different muscles and potentially prevent injuries.

### Running During Weekdays
I realized that sticking to a running schedule during weekdays can be challenging for most people, including myself. I couldn't run at night because it would affect my sleep negatively, and I couldn't run in the morning because I need to send the kids to school. However, I discovered that my office is only a 5-minute walk from the [Victoria Harbour Promenade](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294217-d26321605-Reviews-Victoria_Harbour_Promenade_Wan_Chai_Harbourfront-Hong_Kong.html), and even better, there is a free shower room with lockers along the way. I usually eave my Boston 12 shoes at the office and go for a quick 40-minute run before lunch. This short run is sufficient for a weekday workout, and I feel refreshed after a shower, which helps me perform better in the second half of the workday.

## Race Day

Finally, the big day arrived. For the most part, I felt really good during the marathon, except for the last 10 kilometers when my outter knees started to hurt. (After the marathon, I discovered that this is a common issue called [Ilio-Tibial Band (ITB) Friction Syndrome](https://www.bupa.co.uk/health-information/knee-pain/ilio-tibial-band-itb-friction-syndrome) among runners). I had to slow down my pace significantly and take multiple breaks before reaching the finish line.

Despite the knee pain, I managed to complete the marathon in under five hours (specifically, `04:59:55`). I am extremely happy because I have achieved an important milestone in my life.

## More to Come

Now that I have completed my first marathon, I know what I need to do in order to improve for the next one. I plan to work on strengthening my core and leg muscles, and potentially lose more weight. My goal is to train regularly and be able to participate in three marathons per year.
