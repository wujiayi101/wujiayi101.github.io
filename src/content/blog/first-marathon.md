## Something to Brag About

I completed my [first marathon](https://worldsmarathons.com/marathon/xiamen-international-marathon) on January 7th, 2024. The idea of running a marathon had been on the back of my mind for a few years, but I never took it seriously or felt physically ready. Last summer, I started gaining weight so I decided to start running regularly. Instead of running without a goal, I thought it would be a good idea to sign up for a marathon.

## Building Up the Mileage

### 16-Week Training Program
I found a [16-week training program](https://www.facebook.com/notes/781931189269115/) that I believe had a moderate intensity, and I managed to stick to the schedule, except for one week when I was dealing with a nasty stomach bug.

### Low Heart Rate Training (LHRT)
During my runs, I focused on keeping my heart rate low (learn more about [low heart rate training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_VNQ6UIbS8)). This allowed me to run more frequently, recover faster, and avoid injuries. Compared to six months ago, I am now able to run at a much faster pace while maintaining the same low heart rate, which is quite amazing. I used a Garmin watch to monitor my heart rate and set an alarm to alert me if I exceeded my low heart rate threshold, so I could slow down.


### The Tale of Two Shoes
I purchased two pairs of shoes: the _Adidas Boston 12_ and the _Adidas Adios Pro 3_. I alternated between these two pairs on different days. Each shoes provided a different running experience, allowing me to target different muscles and potentially prevent injuries.

### Running During Weekdays

I realized that sticking to a running schedule during weekdays can be challenging for most people, including myself. I couldn't run at night because it would affect my sleep negatively, and I couldn't run in the morning because I need to send the kids to school. However, I discovered that my office is only a 5-minute walk from the [Victoria Harbour Promenade](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294217-d26321605-Reviews-Victoria_Harbour_Promenade_Wan_Chai_Harbourfront-Hong_Kong.html), and even better, there is a free shower room with lockers along the way. I usually leave my _Boston 12_ at the office and go for a quick 40-minute run before lunch. This short run is sufficient for a weekday workout, and I feel refreshed after a shower, which helps me perform better in the second half of the workday.

## The Big Day

Finally, the big day arrived. For the most part, I felt really good during the marathon, except for the last 10 kilometers when my outter knees started to hurt. (After the marathon, I discovered that this is a common issue called [Ilio-Tibial Band (ITB) Friction Syndrome](https://www.bupa.co.uk/health-information/knee-pain/ilio-tibial-band-itb-friction-syndrome) among runners). I had to slow down my pace significantly and take multiple breaks before reaching the finish line.

Despite experiencing knee pain, I successfully completed the marathon in under 5 hours, specifically in 4 hours, 59 minutes, and 55 seconds. Although it may not be considered a remarkable result, I am incredibly happy because it represents a significant milestone in my life.

## What Have I learned?

Training for a marathon, particularly through the utilization of low heart rate training, has taught me the value of constant improvement, deliberate practice, patience, and perseverance in order to succeed in any long-term endeavor. Especially when practicing LHRT, you have to let go of your ego and run at a very slow pace. It requires patience to gradually build up mileage and see the effects!


## More to come

Now that I have completed my first marathon, I have gained insights into what I need to do to improve for the next one. I plan to focus on strengthening my glute and hip muscles and potentially losing more weight. My goal is to participate in three marathons per year!
